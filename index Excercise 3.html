    <h1>One Republic - Counting Stars</h1>

    <div class="intro">
            Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep <br>
            Dreaming about the things that we could be <br>
            But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard <br>
            Said no more counting dollars <br>
            We'll be <span class="hookline">counting stars</span> <br>
            Yeah, we'll be <span class="hookline">counting stars</span> <br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="verse1">
        I see this life, like a swinging vine <br>
        Swing my heart across the line <br>
        And in my face is flashing signs <br>
        Seek it out and ye' shall find <br>
        Old, but I'm not that old <br>
        Young, but I'm not that bold <br>
        And I don't think the world is sold <br>
        I'm just doing what we're told <br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="pre-chorus">
        I feel something so right <br>
        Doing the wrong thing <br>
        And I feel something so wrong <br>
        Doing the right thing <br>
        I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie <br>
        Everything that kills me makes me feel alive <br>
    </div>

    <div class="verse2">
        I feel your love and I feel it burn <br>
        Down this river, every turn <br>
        Hope is our four-letter word <br>
        Make that money, watch it burn <br>
        Old, but I'm not that old <br>
        Young, but I'm not that bold <br>
        And I don't think the world is sold <br>

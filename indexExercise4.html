    <h2>Quotes</h2>
    <blockquote><em>Cobb:</em> What is the most resilient parasite? Bacteria? A virus? An intestinal worm? An idea. Resilient... highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate. An idea that is fully formed - fully
        understood - that sticks; right in there somewhere.</blockquote>
